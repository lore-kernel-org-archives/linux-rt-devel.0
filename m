Hi, Liam

I only ran the mmap2 use case of will-it-scale. And now I have some new test results, and
I will share the raw data later.

It's processes version.

That's right, this is exactly the test I just completed. I will send a separate
email later.

Yes, that's right. This is important. I also ran it multiple times to observe
data stability and took the average value.

Yes. This make sense to me.

Yes, my test results have been quite stable, probably because the machine was
relatively idle.

Thanks for your reply and discuss!
