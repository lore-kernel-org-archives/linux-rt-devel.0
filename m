I ran tests on two aarch64 boxes and two x86_64 boxes. I ran timerlat on a
set of isolated CPUs (10-30) and serviced the EFI Runtime requests on CPU4.
During the tests I ran operations such as df, efibootmgr, read individual
EFIvars and performed read/write ops to the boxes using efi-rtc. All that,
at regular intervals during the test duration.

I had previously checked the interference/latency generated by these
operations on each box, so I knew what to look for in terms of expected
latency spikes.

On the aarch64 boxes the impact of the EFI-related requests was confined to
CPU4, as expected, and no apparent noise was recorded on the isolated CPUs.

In one of the x86_64 boxes the noise also seemed to be contained to CPU4.
The other box gave me the impression that SMIs were being triggered by the
EFI runtime requests and that was affecting all the CPUs. I will explore
a bit more both x86_64 cases, but I am more than satisfied with the results
of the proposed patches.

Sebastian, as for the TEE feature you mentioned, is there specific test I
should run? Or is there any test you would like me to run in the context of
this change?

In any case,
