My concern is algorithmic, not benchmark optimization.

Suppose that there is only one CPU, or, alternatively, that one of the
atomic SRCU readers is pinned to the same CPU occupied by the (higher
priority) task running synchronize_srcu_atomic().  In this case, the
call to synchronize_srcu_atomic() uselessly burns CPU time until its
priority decays, real-time throttling kicks in, or in some configurations,
maybe never.

Requiring preemption be disabled across both the atomic SRCU readers
and the synchronize_srcu_atomic() avoids this, at least when running on
bare metal.  My (perhaps naive) hope is that guest OSes get some use
out of those cpu_relax() calls.

No hurry.  I am allowing preemption (but dangerously as noted above)
for the moment, and can easily add lockdep checks if and when.

Plus I need to turn my rcutorture changes from shameless hacks into
something maintainable.  And find and fix the inevitable remaining bugs.
